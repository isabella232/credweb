# Inspection

Basic process:

1. Gather and maintain descriptions of individual features (of web sites, web pages, web page fragments) which might indicate credibility
2. Gather and maintain information about the suitability of these indicators for credibility assessment

## Proposals

* Propose indicators

## Evaluation

* Threat analysis (assess gameability)
* IRR
* correlation to experts
* relationship to other features (stats: feature analysis)

## Communication

* Document
* Test suites
* Track implementations



# Corroboration


## Modeling of Claims

## Assisted Fact-Checking ("input side")

## Propagate Fact-Checks ("output side")




# Reputation

## Shared Whitelists

* Develop a system which can be used by Corroboration or Transparency systems to work with chosen (instead of centralized) trusted-source lists.

## Extended Trust Networks

* Support arbitrary people presenting evidence or expressing opinion and being vetted by their position in the social trust graph of the individual user
* Make robust against coersion and corruption of incentivized trust statements
* Make robust against false negative reputation attacks



# Transparency

## Human-readable fields

## Shared formal vocabulary for features
